These two word queries take around >300ms, so we are looking for the root
cause of what is increasing the search time.

The more unique letters a query has, the longer our search engine takes.
We think this is because of how our current implementation has to open
and close a file for each unique first letter. For example, query #3 takes
1785ms, while query #5 takes 459ms. This is a significant increase, despite
them both having the same length. Between #4 and #5, the search time between
same letter queries of different lengths is marginal.
